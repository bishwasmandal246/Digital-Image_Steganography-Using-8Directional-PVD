# Digital-Image_Steganography-Using-8Directional-PVD
Based on an existing algorithm in spatial domain
MATLAB 
The code is all set to go all you need to do is create a text file which you want to embed and select an image which you want the text to be embedded at.
Change the image name in the code with your image name once you decide which image you want to take
